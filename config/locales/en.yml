        <p>
          <b>cocarto</b> is a <b>collaborative</b> tool for collecting and managing <b>structured</b> and <b>geospatialized</b> data.
        </p>
        For exemple:
        <ul>
          <li>the route and the legs of a hike in Corsica,</li>
          <li>the automobile equipment rate by department in 2019,</li>
          <li>the cycling infrastructure in the 19th district of Paris.</li>
        </ul>
      section_2_html: |
        <span>You don't need to be a specialist to create a <b>cohesive</b> and <b>reusable</b> database:</span>
        <ul>
          <li>A map is composed of several layers of homogeneous geographical objects: points, lines, polygons, administrative territories.</li>
          <li>Each layer defines typed attributes: numbers, text, dates, lists, booleans, images…</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          cocarto guarantees the <b>validity of the data</b> entered. It is not possible to put text for a boolean attribute or a number.<br>
          The administrative territories are referenced: no ambiguity on the postal or INSEE code, or on the spelling.
        </p>
      section_3_html: |
        <p>
          <b>cocarto</b> is designed for teamwork.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you work with several people on the same map, each other's contributions appear in <b>real time</b>.<br>
          You have precise control over who can access your data: read-only, write-only, or one-time contribution…
        </p>
        Coming soon:
        <ul>
          <li>changes history management and rollback;</li>
          <li>import, export, re-import…</li>
          <li>and <a href="https://gitlab.com/CodeursEnLiberte/cocarto/-/issues" target="_blank">many other things</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      section_4_html: |
        <p>
          <b>cocarto</b> is <b>free</b> and <b>open-source</b> software.
          You can work directly on <a href="https://cocarto.com">cocarto.com</a>, or install the software on your own servers.
        </p>
        <p>
          cocarto is built in a <b>transparent</b> way by <a href="https://www.codeursenliberté.fr" target="_blank">Codeurs en Liberté</a>, our small cooperative company. We will not be bought by a tech giant.
          You can follow the development <a href="https://gitlab.com/codeursenliberte.fr/cocarto" target="_blank">on the project page</a> or via <a href="https://buttondown.email/cocarto" target="_blank">our newsletter</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea of cocarto came to us through contact with structures and administrations that share data, in a more or less artisanal and often uncomfortable way.
          We are listening to the remarks!<br>
        </p>
